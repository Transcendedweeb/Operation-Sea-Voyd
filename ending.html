            Vodyanoyza was first spotted by the scientist working for the KGB. It’s origins are unknown. The length of 
            Vodyanoyza is estimated to be 120 meters. It’s whereabouts has been located deep in the Atlantic ocean. We have been closely 
            monitoring the apex predator Vodyanoyza, now slowly heading towards West-Europe. Scientist have tracked the roots of Vodyanoyza 
            back to a Slavic mythology of a evil water spirit called the vodyanoy. Capable of destroying the world the KGB has started the production of 
            чудовище missiles, a newly engineered missiles named ‘’Monster’’ strong enough to destroy whole continents. The KGB has chosen to keep this a 
            secret to prevent panic outbreaks and keep everything under control. It has been confirmed that Vodyanoyza is non friendly and destroys anything 
            in it’s path. Scientists are convinced that this apex predator has been asleep for billions of years and has now been awoken due to unknown factors. 
            We were able to read off the vital signs and learn that Vodyanoyza is still in his ‘’sleep mode’’ and that this is our only chance to kill it.

                What..? I don’t get it….Vodyanoyza? This can’t be real. Everything I did, everything I accomplished, everybody that I killed was for me to 
                stop the missiles, to finish this mission. If I stop the launch Vodyanoyza will reach Europe and destroy everything in its path. If I launch the 
                missiles it could save the world from this apex predator, but trigger another world war. The future of the world is in my hands now.

            The missile explosion was so grand it took your life with it… You may have taken down a monster but by not telling 
            the world it started another world war and many lives have been lost. The USA saw the missile launch as an attack on t
            heir nation and declared war.

            Everything that you found, you took back to the United States and showed it to the world. Instead of mass hysteria, 
            leaders all around the world started working together to take down the real enemy. The first missile launch against Vodyanoyza 
            was successful and the apex predator was taken down. Not only did you prevent another world war from happening but you also
